The Wilton High School principal Dr. O'Donnell believes that having sustainability goals and initiatives is important. Each student can play a part to make our school more environmentally friendly. One issue Dr. O'Donnell pointed out was the use of plastic water bottles. Many students choose to throw them in the trash instead of using the recycling bins. Our school also has water bottle refilling stations that can help students reduce the use of plastic bottles. Wilton High School has also implemented solar power and converted from petroleum to gas fuel sources. He says that the school is constantly working to optimize energy use by decreasing energy consumption while the building is not in use. In an extended interview, Dr. O'Donnell mentioned the school's use of green cleaning products and the recycling program.

    <p>Wilton High School recently added textile recycling bins in the entrance to the senior parking lot. Old clothing and other textiles can be recycled in these bins. Items like shirts, linens, hats, gloves, and even old shoes can be recycled. Some textiles are reused and others are recycled into other products. This promotes local sustainability and decreases unnecessary waste.</p>
